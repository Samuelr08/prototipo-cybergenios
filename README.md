## ✅ Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),  the package manager [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable), Java - JDK11, [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) OR [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#requirements) and it is good also to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 👀 How can you see this work?

The easiest way to run the project is using Expo to emulate the application directly from a mobile device with no need to install Android Studio.

- Open the folder project, and tap this command on terminal to install the development dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

- If you already installed Expo Go on your mobile device and Expo CLI on your machine you, from the folder project in a terminal you can run:
```bash
expo start
```

- then open the Expo Go in your mobile device and scan the QR code that was open in your terminal.

🏄🏻 Now you can navigate on it. Have fun!
